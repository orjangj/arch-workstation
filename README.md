# Workstation
This repository contains my personal set of playbooks for provisioning my Linux workstation.

It supports:

- Ubuntu
- Arch Linux
- Fedora

## TODO
- ansible_usr_id/dir vs owner: etc...
- Make arch, fedora and debian work...
- Rename repo to "workstation"
- fix qtile for wayland -- separate x11 and wayland
- pip packages in config.yml
- dotfiles: compton --> picom... awesome wm... xinitrc?
- startx -- bash_profile (or .profile)
